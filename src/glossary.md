# MOMSI Terminology

MOMSI WG terms and concepts are organized and grouped by scoped curation activity themes. Themes cover MOMSI subject area class and subclass relationships specific to application technology, FAIRsharing standard record types, and research data lifecycle stages. Each term provided in the glossary table below contains a term name, definition (definition source), related persistent identifier (where applicable), topic areas (grouped by theme), and linked  relations. Most terms listed in the table below are used in our Omics issue request templates and used throughout the dashboard documentation.

_Note: MOMSI WG defined terms in the glossary have not been assigned an identifier and are labeled as "ungrounded". After WG output community review and feedback we will further refine these selection terms as needed and seek opportunities to add these terms to an existing maintained ontology collection within scope._

## Glossary Table (pending)

```js
import {Mutable} from "observablehq:stdlib";
const data = await FileAttachment("data/glossary.json").json()
const dataColumns = {
	"glossary": ["Term", "Definition", "Identifier", "Topic", "Related"]
}
let standardChoice = Mutable("glossary")
let columnChoice = Mutable(dataColumns["glossary"])
let dataChoice = Mutable(data["glossary"])
}

function changeStandardChoice(value) {
	standardChoice.value = value
	columnChoice.value = dataColumns[value]
	return value
}

const choice = view(Inputs.button([
  ["glossary", value => value = changeStandardChoice("glossary")],
], {value: "glossary"}));
const searchGInput = Inputs.search(data["glossary"], {placeholder: "Search glossary terms ..."});
const searchG = Generators.input(searchGInput);
```

<div class="card" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 0.5rem;">
  ${ standardChoice === "glossary" ? searchGInput  : "" }
  ${ standardChoice === "glossary" ? Inputs.table(searchG, {columns: columnChoice, format: dataFormat})
	 : "" }
</div>

## Terminology Themes & Curated Concepts

### FAIRsharing Standards & Subject Area Terms
The MOMSI WG landscape review captures a set of curated community standard record types, as defined by [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/standards), in supporting FAIR machine-actionable resources and enriching existing RDA WG partnerships under a shared aim to improve data standard quality reporting, discovery, and reuse.

> - **[Terminology Artefacts](https://github.com/RDA-MOMSI/Dashboard/blob/main/src/glossary/Terminology-Artefacts.md)** represent controlled vocabularies and ontologies used to enable semantic precision and hierarchy of domain terms, text mapping persistence, and improved structured knowledge extraction for integration.
 > - **[Reporting Guidelines](https://github.com/RDA-MOMSI/Dashboard/blob/main/src/glossary/Reporting-Guidelines.md)** represent a sets of required metadata attributes documenting how the data was derived and by what specific high-throughput collection method, ensuring the data generated by a given method can be easily verified, analyzed, and interpreted by the scientific community for informed reuse. 
 > - **[Models or Formats](https://github.com/RDA-MOMSI/Dashboard/blob/main/src/glossary/Models-or-Formats.md)** represent structured data extensions or common formats that describe a specific experimental data type or resource infrastructure for which data and metadata information can be exchanged, enabling interoperability among infrastructure systems supporting preservation.
 > - **[Identifier Schemas](https://github.com/RDA-MOMSI/Dashboard/blob/main/src/glossary/Identifier-Schemas.md)** represent records that are intended to describe persistent and unique identifiers intended for sharing and reuse across multiple resources for reporting the location of where the data being described is stored.


#### Tagged Term Identifiers
The MOMSI glossary leverages shared subject term identifiers from SRAO and EDAM in compatibility with tagged terms implemented by FAIRsharing for aligning semantics across the dashboard and collection advanced queries. Subject terms are used to describe standards listed in our glossary representative of our landscape review and are in alignment with the [FAIRsharing Subject Ontology (SRAO)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/srao) where applicable. SRAO is a hierarchy of academic disciplines that draws from the re3data subject list as well as imports terms from 7 publicly-available ontologies covering a broad range subject matter terms. Where external vocabularies could not be grounded to existing ontologies, SRAO classes exist. The [terms4FAIRskills (T4FS)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/t4fs) identifiers are used for RDMkit and MOMSI research data lifecycle terms to support FAIR data stewardship.


### Research Data Lifecycle Curated Concepts & Selection Criteria
Core concept terms, as defined by the RDMkit resource, are implemented in our issues requests and represent potential standard selections based on data management  [roles](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/your_role) and [tasks](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/your_tasks) performed at each stage (Planning, Collecting, Processing, Analyzing, Preserving, Sharing, Reusing). Concept subclass terms, as defined by the MOMSI WG, are used for expanding on core RDMkit data lifecycle terms with domain use-cases representing data management or stewardship tasks as they apply under each stage.
