term: Preservation

definition: Data preservation consists of a series of activities necessary to ensure safety, integrity and accessibility of data for as long as necessary, even decades. Data preservation is indeed more than just data storage and backup, since data can be stored and backed up without being preserved. Data preservation prevents data from becoming unavailable and unusable over time through appropriate steps (definition source: [RDMkit Preserving](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/preserving)).
