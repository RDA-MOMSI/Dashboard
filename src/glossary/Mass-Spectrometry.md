term: Mass Spectrometry

definition: Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique that is used to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. The results are presented as a _[mass spectrum](https://identifiers.org/MS:1000294)_, a plot of intensity as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. Mass spectrometry is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as complex mixtures (definition source: Wikipedia, PSI-MS CV).
