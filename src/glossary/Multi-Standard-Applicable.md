term: Multi-Standard Applicable

definition: Standard record types that represent more than one type of record based on the construction of the standard and the different dependencies that may not be fully represented when combined. For example, a reporting guideline that contains a specific set of ontologies/controlled vocabularies or identifier schemas. Or a data model schema format that represents specific standard reporting guideline as part of its requirements. Multi-Standard Applicable record representations can be captured in FAIRsharing using the different standard record relationship types (profiles, extends, related to, etc.) for associating these unique dependencies **(definition source: MOMSI WG)**.
