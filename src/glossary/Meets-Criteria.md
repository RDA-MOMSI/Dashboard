term: Meets Criteria

definition: Curated MOMSI landscape review standards that meet the minimum level of required metadata information (see issue request form) representing at least 1 of the core 4 Subject Area Classes (Genomics, Proteomics, Metabolomics, and Universal standards). These standards have a status of "[Established and Maintained](https://github.com/RDA-MOMSI/Dashboard/blob/main/src/glossary/Established-and-Maintained.md)" and improve or enhance Omics domain community-accepted standard adoption. Broader [Universal standards](https://github.com/RDA-MOMSI/Dashboard/blob/main/src/glossary/Universal-Standards.md) selected serve to enhance interoperability and machine-actionable developments of [Multi-Omics](https://github.com/RDA-MOMSI/Dashboard/blob/main/src/glossary/Multi-Omics.md) standards intended for data integration or overall FAIR best practices. Standards that meet the required criteria are down-selected from the dashboard and included at the MOMSI WG FAIRsharing Standards Collection **(definition source: MOMSI WG)**.
