term: Subject Agnostic

definition: Subject Agnostic provides a way of describing research and resources that are applicable across all subject areas. Please note that this term does not, by default, mean that an object tagged with it is completely generic. An example, such as JPEG is considered Subject Agnostic, meaning that the resource is applicable regardless of subject area, but it does not mean that it can or should be used for any type of data (definition source: MOMSI WG, SRAO).
