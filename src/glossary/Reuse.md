term: Reuse

definition: Data reuse means using data for other purposes than it was originally collected for. Reuse of data is particularly important in science, as it allows different researchers to analyze and publish findings based on the same data independently of one another. Reusability is one key component of the FAIR principles (definition source: [RDMkit Reusing](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/reusing)).
