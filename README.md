Welcome to the¬†[Multi-Omics Metadata Standards Integration (MOMSI) Working Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/multi-omics-metadata-standards-integration-momsi-wg) community-driven Multi-Omics standard landscape review curation workflow and interactive web-based dashboard tool. Explore >250 standards from our Omics Landscape Review (Deliverable 1a) repository containing Multi-omics domain (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, etc.) and universal (generalist) standards curated by the MOMSI WG. 

### üéØ Scope

This repository contains an iterative list of curated controlled vocabularies/ontologies, metadata reporting guidelines, data models/formats, and identifier schemas relevant to Omics application technologies and FAIR best practices. The [MOMSI WG Landscape Review Dashboard](https://rda-momsi.github.io/Dashboard) is designed to support continuous curation of Omics domain and generalist community-accepted standards in real time aiding next-generation Multi-Omics data integration platform system developments, refinements, and new implementations.

### üë• Usage

This resource supports users interested in Multi-omics data and metadata standards development, integration, and data platform system developments across MOMSI domain subject areas in Genomics, Proteomics, Metabolomics, and Lipidomics corresponding to application technologies in sequencing and mass spectrometry. Our live curation workflow aims to provide expert level (domain-informed) recommendation resources for non-expert professionals tasked with data management planning and forecasting tasks.

**Target Audience:**
 - Researchers (data and metadata generators/stewards)
 - Data Support Professionals (data managers/project managers)
 - Developers (data and metadata consumers/generators/standard creators)
 - Data Curators (data quality assurance assessors)
 - Data Publishers (service providers)

> **Not sure where to begin?**
> - Browse [User Journeys](https://rda-momsi.github.io/Dashboard/user-journeys) linked at the dashboard homepage for themed use-case exploration of Omics standard types, research data lifecycle curations, and core Omics subject area classes/subclasses.
> - Visit our [MOMSI Terminology](https://rda-momsi.github.io/Dashboard/glossary) linked at the dashboard homepage for curated concepts and terms used to organize and filter the tags listed at the dashboard and at the MOMSI FAIRsharing Collection (see sustainability section below).

#### üôå CRediT

As part of the MOMSI WG sustainability workflow, supporting community best practices and transparency, all dashboard community contributions are captured using the [CRediT Taxonomy Roles](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.fe4816) standard terminology and [ORCID](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.OrNi1L) identifiers.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Governance

This repository is maintained by the MOMSI WG co-chairs. Co-chair duties include quality review of curated standards prior to merge and standard additions to the FAIRsharing Collection as record owners.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Sustainability

As part of our sustainability workflow and long-term maintenance plan this repository was established to provide a transparent method for sharing expert-level information with non-expert users. Expert curated Multi-Omics standards, originally captured in a Google Sheet, now available in a machine-actionable and version controlled environment, enables open-access to live curated WG deliverables for continuous update by the scientific community as future standards evolve. This repository serves as the first step in our sustainability workflow process for downstream inclusion at our [MOMSI FAIRsharing Standards Collection (Deliverable 1b)](https://fairsharing.org/5742), in collaboration with the RDA FAIRsharing WG.
